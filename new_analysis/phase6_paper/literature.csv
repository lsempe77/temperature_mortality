"The impact of temperature on mortality in a subtropical city: effects of cold, heat, and heat waves in São Paulo, Brazil","In So Paulo, Brazil, both cold and heat affect mortality, with cold affecting cardiovascular health and heat affecting respiratory health.","J. Son, N. Gouveia, M. Bravo, C. Freitas, M. Bell",2015,108,"Understanding how weather impacts health is critical, especially under a changing climate; however, relatively few studies have investigated subtropical regions. We examined how mortality in São Paulo, Brazil, is affected by cold, heat, and heat waves over 14.5 years (1996-2010). We used over-dispersed generalized linear modeling to estimate heat- and cold-related mortality, and Bayesian hierarchical modeling to estimate overall effects and modification by heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing in season). Stratified analyses were performed by cause of death and individual characteristics (sex, age, education, marital status, and place of death). Cold effects on mortality appeared higher than heat effects in this subtropical city with moderate climatic conditions. Heat was associated with respiratory mortality and cold with cardiovascular mortality. Risk of total mortality was 6.1% (95% confidence interval 4.7, 7.6%) higher at the 99th percentile of temperature than the 90th percentile (heat effect) and 8.6% (6.2, 11.1%) higher at the 1st compared to the 10th percentile (cold effect). Risks were higher for females and those with no education for heat effect, and males for cold effect. Older persons, widows, and non-hospital deaths had higher mortality risks for heat and cold. Mortality during heat waves was higher than on non-heat wave days for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Our findings indicate that mortality in São Paulo is associated with both cold and heat and that some subpopulations are more vulnerable.","non-rct observational study","International Journal of Biometeorology","1","10.1007/s00484-015-1009-7","https://consensus.app/papers/the-impact-of-temperature-on-mortality-in-a-subtropical-son-gouveia/c0f09c6d332f54dd92cfaeff37cfbf51/"
"Effect modifiers of the temperature-mortality association for general and older adults population of Brazil’s metropolitan areas","Ambient temperature affects mortality differently in Brazilian metropolitan areas, with cold temperatures having a greater impact than heat, and implementing adaptive measures depends on the profile of each location.","Cristiane Aschidamini, Antônio Carlos Monteiro Ponce de Leon",2025,0,"Ambient temperature effect on mortality varies between places and populations, suggesting the existence of effect modifiers for this association. This study analyzes the influence of geographic, urban, and socioeconomic factors on the ambient temperature effect on non-accidental mortality in the general and older adults population of Brazilian metropolitan areas, and on that associated with circulatory, respiratory, and other mortality in older adults. Effects of this association were estimated for each group in 42 locations using a generalized additive model combined with the nonlinear distributed lag model. A meta-analysis was then performed to estimate the effects at the national and regional levels. Meta-regression determined the influence of effect modifiers. Estimated relative risks of the temperature-mortality association varied between locations in the Brazilian territory. Heat effects on non-accidental mortality at the national level were 1.09 (95%CI: 1.04-1.15) and 1.13 (95%CI: 1.07-1.20) for the General and Older Adult groups, respectively. Cold effects were 1.26 (95%CI: 1.21-1.32) and 1.30 (95%CI: 1.24-1.36) for the General and Older Adult groups, respectively. We observed a greater effect of cold than heat in both groups. For all causes of death, effects of heat and cold were greater in the Southeast and South Brazil. Amplitude of the mean temperature was the factor that best explained the heterogeneity between locations, followed by latitude, income and schooling. Hence, implementing adaptive measures to reduce the ambient temperature effects on mortality depends on the profile of each location.","meta-analysis","Cadernos de Saúde Pública","2","10.1590/0102-311xen042524","https://consensus.app/papers/effect-modifiers-of-the-temperaturemortality-aschidamini-leon/bb5e27ba781b5629b2cb9b4c18e8ead4/"

Fecht, M. Pirani, F. Piel, A. Nardocci, P. Vineis",2022,8,"Exposure to non-optimal temperatures remains the single most deathful direct climate change impact to health. The risk varies based on the adaptation capacity of the exposed population which can be driven by climatic and/or non-climatic factors subject to fluctuations over time. We investigated temporal changes in the exposure–response relationship between daily mean temperature and mortality by cause of death, sex, age, and ethnicity in the megacity of São Paulo, Brazil (2000–2018). We fitted a quasi-Poisson regression model with time-varying distributed-lag non-linear model (tv-DLNM) to obtain annual estimates. We used two indicators of adaptation: trends in the annual minimum mortality temperature (MMT), i.e., temperature at which the mortality rate is the lowest, and in the cumulative relative risk (cRR) associated with extreme cold and heat. Finally, we evaluated their association with annual mean temperature and annual extreme cold and heat, respectively to assess the role of climatic and non-climatic drivers. In total, we investigated 4,471,000 deaths from non-external causes. We found significant temporal trends for both the MMT and cRR indicators. The former was decoupled from changes in AMT, whereas the latter showed some degree of alignment with extreme heat and cold, suggesting the role of both climatic and non-climatic adaptation drivers. Finally, changes in MMT and cRR varied substantially by sex, age, and ethnicity, exposing disparities in the adaptation capacity of these population groups.

"Effects of heat waves on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Heat waves in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, increase the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, with greater effects on respiratory mortality than cardiovascular mortality, and women and the elderly being most vulnerable.","I. Silveira, T. Cortes, Morag Bell, W. Junger",2023,32,"Heat waves are becoming more intense and extreme as a consequence of global warming. Epidemiological evidence reveals the health impacts of heat waves in mortality and morbidity outcomes, however, few studies have been conducted in tropical regions, which are characterized by high population density, low income and low health resources, and susceptible to the impacts of extreme heat on health. The aim of this paper is to estimate the effects of heat waves on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to sex, age, and heat wave intensity. We carried out a time-stratified case-crossover study stratified by sex, age (0-64 and 65 or above), and by sex for the older group. Our analyses were restricted to the hot season. We included 42,926 participants, 29,442 of whom died from cardiovascular and 13,484 from respiratory disease, between 2012 and 2017. The death data were obtained from Rio de Janeiro's Municipal Health Department. We estimated individual-level exposure using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, with temperature and humidity data from 13 and 12 stations, respectively. We used five definitions of heat waves, based on temperature thresholds (90th, 92.5th, 95th, 97.5th, and 99th of individual daily mean temperature in the hot season over the study period) and a duration of two or more days. Conditional logistic regression combined with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were used to estimate the short-term and delayed effects of heat waves on mortality over a lag period (5 days for cardiovascular and 10 for respiratory mortality). The models were controlled for daily mean absolute humidity and public holidays. The odds ratios (OR) increase as heat waves intensify, although some effect estimates are not statistically significant at 95% level when we applied the most stringent heat wave criteria. Although not statistically different, our central estimates suggest that the effects were greater for respiratory than cardiovascular mortality. Results stratified by sex and age were also not statistically different, but suggest that older people and women were more vulnerable to the effects of heat waves, although for some heat wave definitions, the OR for respiratory mortality were higher among the younger group. The results also indicate that older women are the most vulnerable to heat wave-related cardiovascular mortality. Our results show an increase in the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality on heat wave days compared to non-heat wave ones. These effects increase with heat wave intensity, and evidence suggests that they were greater for respiratory mortality than cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, the results also suggest that women and the elderly constitute the groups most vulnerable to heat waves.","non-rct observational study","PLOS ONE","1","10.1371/journal.pone.0283899","https://consensus.app/papers/effects-of-heat-waves-on-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-silveira-cortes/57798b2dde3f5d47b7264310e67ddf5a/"

Trigo",2024,27,"Population exposure to heat waves (HWs) is increasing worldwide due to climate change, significantly affecting society, including public health. Despite its significant vulnerabilities and limited adaptation resources to rising temperatures, South America, particularly Brazil, lacks research on the health impacts of temperature extremes, especially on the role played by socioeconomic factors in the risk of heat-related illness. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of HWs on mortality rates in the 14 most populous urban areas, comprising approximately 35% of the country's population. Excess mortality during HWs was estimated through the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E) for total deaths during the events identified. Moreover, the interplay of intersectionality and vulnerability to heat considering demographics and socioeconomic heterogeneities, using gender, age, race, and educational level as proxies, as well as the leading causes of heat-related excess death, were assessed. A significant increase in the frequency was observed from the 1970s (0-3 HWs year-1) to the 2010s (3-11 HWs year-1), with higher tendencies in the northern, northeastern, and central-western regions. Over the 2000-2018 period, 48,075 (40,448-55,279) excessive deaths were attributed to the growing number of HWs (>20 times the number of landslides-related deaths for the same period). Nevertheless, our event-based surveillance analysis did not detect the HW-mortality nexus, reinforcing that extreme heat events are a neglected disaster in Brazil. Among the leading causes of death, diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems and neoplasms were the most frequent. Critical regional differences were observed, which can be linked to the sharp North-South inequalities in terms of socioeconomic and health indicators, such as life expectancy. Higher heat-related excess mortality was observed for low-educational level people, blacks and browns, older adults, and females. Such findings highlight that the strengthening of primary health care combined with reducing socioeconomic, racial, and gender inequalities represents a crucial step to reducing heat-related deaths.","non-rct observational study","PLOS ONE","1","10.1371/journal.pone.0295766","https://consensus.app/papers/twentyfirstcentury-demographic-and-social-inequalities-santos-libonati/fd12acd56d3551ad9c149e3687538822/"

The exposure variable was the daily mean temperature from Copernicus ERA5-Land reanalysis. The association was estimated from a two-stage time series analysis method. We also calculated deaths attributable to heat and cold. The pooled exposure-response curve presented a J-shaped format. The exposure to extreme heat increased the risk of mortality by 27% (95% CI: 15-39%), while the exposure to extreme cold increased the risk of mortality by 16% (95% CI: 8-24%).

"Socioeconomic differentials in the temperature-mortality relationship in São Paulo, Brazil.","In So Paulo, Brazil, the U-shaped temperature-mortality relationship is found, with similar effects across socioeconomic groups.","N. Gouveia, S. Hajat, B. Armstrong",2003,210,"BACKGROUND
We investigated the impact of environmental temperature on mortality in São Paulo, Brazil, and examined differences in the temperature-mortality relationship with respect to cause, age group, and socioeconomic position (SEP).


METHODS
Generalized additive Poisson regression models adjusted for non-temperature related seasonal factors (including air pollution) were used to analyse daily mortality counts for selected causes from 1991 to 1994. Individuals were classified by the aggregate SEP of their area of residency. These were analysed as potential modifiers of the temperature-mortality relationship.


RESULTS
Among the elderly we observed a 2.6% increase in all-cause mortality per degree increase in temperature above 20 degrees C, and a 5.5% increase per degree drop in temperature below 20 degrees C, after adjustment for confounding. Relationships were similar in children, but somewhat weaker in adults. Cold effects were present for deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory, and other causes, with effects being greatest in the respiratory group. Heat effects were not found for CVD deaths in adults, but otherwise varied little by cause of mortality. There was little evidence for a modification of the mortality effects of cold or heat by SEP.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings show that the U-shaped pattern of the temperature-mortality relationship found in cooler northern countries occurs also in a sub-tropical city. In addition, the relative effects of temperature were similar in each socioeconomic grouping.","non-rct observational study","International journal of epidemiology","1","10.1093/ije/dyg077","https://consensus.app/papers/socioeconomic-differentials-in-the-gouveia-hajat/1a5e8766edc150a4ade492fc9089e2cb/"

Williams, S. Tong",2017,393,"Background: Few studies have examined variation in the associations between heat waves and mortality in an international context. Objectives: We aimed to systematically examine the impacts of heat waves on mortality with lag effects internationally. Methods: We collected daily data of temperature and mortality from 400 communities in 18 countries/regions and defined 12 types of heat waves by combining community-specific daily mean temperature ≥90th, 92.5th, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles of temperature with duration ≥2, 3, and 4 d. We used time-series analyses to estimate the community-specific heat wave–mortality relation over lags of 0–10 d. Then, we applied meta-analysis to pool heat wave effects at the country level for cumulative and lag effects for each type of heat wave definition. Results: Heat waves of all definitions had significant cumulative associations with mortality in all countries, but varied by community. The higher the temperature threshold used to define heat waves, the higher heat wave associations on mortality. However, heat wave duration did not modify the impacts. The association between heat waves and mortality appeared acutely and lasted for 3 and 4 d. Heat waves had higher associations with mortality in moderate cold and moderate hot areas than cold and hot areas. There were no added effects of heat waves on mortality in all countries/regions, except for Brazil, Moldova, and Taiwan. Heat waves defined by daily mean and maximum temperatures produced similar heat wave–mortality associations, but not daily minimum temperature. Conclusions: Results indicate that high temperatures create a substantial health burden, and effects of high temperatures over consecutive days are similar to what would be experienced if high temperature days occurred independently. People living in moderate cold and moderate hot areas are more sensitive to heat waves than those living in cold and hot areas.

Results showed that the highest absolute mortality values during heat-related events were linked to circulatory illnesses. However, the highest excess of mortality was related to diabetes, particularly for women within the elderly age groups. Moreover, results indicate that accumulated heat stress conditions during consecutive days preferentially preceded by persistent periods of moderate-temperature, lead to higher excess mortality rather than sporadic single hot days.

Réquia, Reizane Maria Damasceno da Silva, Leonardo Hoinaski, Heresh Amini",2024,1,"Conventional temperature-based approaches often overlook the intricate nature of thermal stress experienced by individuals. To address this limitation, climatologists have developed thermal indices—composite measures designed to reflect the complex interaction of meteorological factors influencing human perception of temperature. Our study focuses on Brazil, estimating the association between thermal comfort conditions and mortality related to respiratory and circulatory diseases. We examined four distinct thermal indices: the discomfort index (DI), net effective temperature (NET), humidex (H), and heat index (HI). Analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 2,872,084 deaths from 2003 to 2017, we found significant variation in relative risk (RR) based on health outcomes, exposure lag, percentile of exposure, sex/age groups, and specific thermal indices. For example, under high exposure conditions (99th percentile), we observed that the shorter lags (3, 5, 7, and 10) had the most robust effects on all-cause mortality. For example, under lag 3, the pooled national results for the overall population (all ages and sexes) indicate an increased risk of all-cause mortality, with an RR of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.13; 1.122) for DI, 1.15 (95% CI: 1.12; 1.17) for H, 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09; 1.21) for HI, and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13; 1.22) for NET. At low exposure levels (1st percentile), all four distinct thermal indices were linked to an increase in all-cause mortality across most sex and age subgroups. Specifically, for lag 20, we observed an estimated RR of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.14; 1.23) for DI, 1.12 (95% CI: 1.08; 1.16) for H, 1.17 (95% CI: 1.12; 1.22) for HI, and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.14; 1.23) for NET.

Fernández-Medina, Eduardo Mesquita Peixoto, Denis Rodrigues, Rodrigo Said, Cleonice Andrade Holanda, Cristina da Silva Freire, Aline Maria de Almeida, Silvia Cristina de Carvalho Cardoso, Mário Sergio Ribeiro, Claudia Maria Braga de Mello, Alex Rosewell, Luciane Velasque",2025,0,"ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the excess mortality associated with the November 2023 extreme heat wave in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with temperatures reaching 42°C. Methods: Using the excess heat factor (EHF) to characterize the heat wave, this study identified elevated excess mortality across various disease categories, including symptoms and abnormal clinical findings, nervous system disorders, mental health conditions, and genitourinary diseases, diverging from typical heat-related mortality patterns. Results: This event resulted in an estimated excess mortality of 1 392 individuals in a short period, disproportionately affecting older adults and women, with a significant number of deaths occurring at home. The findings underscore the complexity of heat wave impacts and highlight gaps in health care access, risk perception, and clinical management. Conclusions: Heat waves are increasingly recognized as a significant public health threat, exacerbated by climate change, with profound impacts on morbidity and mortality. The study emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive heat alert and response systems, intersectoral action plans, and public education to mitigate the effects of extreme heat. Furthermore, it calls for adaptive strategies in urban planning, housing, and public health policies to address the growing frequency and intensity of heat waves in the context of climate change. As Brazil faces escalating challenges from rising temperatures, particularly in urban centers, coordinated multisectoral efforts are essential to protect vulnerable populations and reduce heat-related mortality in the future.","non-rct observational study","Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública","","10.26633/rpsp.2025.76","https://consensus.app/papers/excess-mortality-associated-with-extreme-heat-in-rio-de-fern%C3%A1ndez-medina-peixoto/9b53823d95e25a3393b9d0f345d2ff58/"

We calculated the attributable deaths for cold and heat as the 2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles, above and below the minimum mortality temperature, and used the value of a life year to estimate the economic loss of delayed deaths. Results: The mortality impact of cold varied widely by country, from 9.64% in Uruguay to 0.22% in Costa Rica.

We quantified the heatwave–hospitalization association in Brazil during 2000–2015. Methods and findings Daily data on hospitalization and temperature were collected from 1,814 cities (>78% of the national population) in the hottest five consecutive months during 2000–2015. Twelve types of heatwaves were defined with daily mean temperatures of ≥90th, 92.5th, 95th, or 97.5th percentiles of year-round temperature and durations of ≥2, 3, or 4 consecutive days. The city-specific association was estimated using a quasi-Poisson regression with constrained distributed lag model and then pooled at the national level using random-effect meta-analysis. Stratified analyses were performed by five regions, sex, 10 age groups, and nine cause categories. The temporal change in the heatwave–hospitalization association was assessed using a time-varying constrained distributed lag model. Of the 58,400,682 hospitalizations (59% women), 24%, 34%, 21%, and 19% of cases were aged <20, 20–39, 40–59, and ≥60 years, respectively. The city-specific year-round daily mean temperatures were 23.5 ± 2.8 °C on average, varying from 26.8 ± 1.8 °C for the 90th percentile to 28.0 ± 1.6 °C for the 97.5th percentile. We observed that the risk of hospitalization was most pronounced for heatwaves characterized by high daily temperatures and long durations across Brazil, except for the minimal association in the north (the hottest region). After controlling for temperature, the association remained for severe heatwaves in the south and southeast (cold regions). Children 0–9 years, the elderly ≥70 years, and admissions for perinatal conditions were most strongly associated with heatwaves. Over the study period, the strength of the heatwave–hospitalization association declined substantially in the south, while an apparent increase was observed in the southeast. The main limitations of this study included the lack of data on individual temperature exposure and measured air pollution. Conclusions There are geographic, demographic, cause-specific, and temporal variations in the heatwave–hospitalization associations across the Brazilian population.

We observed a reduction in the MMT for most population groups, except elderly and Non-White males.Interpretation: Our findings highlight the importance of exploring adaptation patterns by population groups and revising periodically the associated risk to correctly inform climate change impact predictions and public health initiatives.

The cities were: Delhi, Monterrey, Mexico City, Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Salvador, São Paulo, Santiago, Cape Town, Ljubljana, Bucharest and Sofia. For each city, daily mortality was examined in relation to ambient temperature using autoregressive Poisson models (2- to 5-year series) adjusted for season, relative humidity, air pollution, day of week and public holidays. Most cities showed a U-shaped temperature-mortality relationship, with clear evidence of increasing death rates at colder temperatures in all cities except Ljubljana, Salvador and Delhi and with increasing heat in all cities except Chiang Mai and Cape Town. Estimates of the temperature threshold below which cold-related mortality began to increase ranged from 15 degrees C to 29 degrees C; the threshold for heat-related deaths ranged from 16 degrees C to 31 degrees C. Heat thresholds were generally higher in cities with warmer climates, while cold thresholds were unrelated to climate. Urban populations, in diverse geographic settings, experience increases in mortality due to both high and low temperatures. The effects of heat and cold vary depending on climate and non-climate factors such as the population disease profile and age structure. Although such populations will undergo some adaptation to increasing temperatures, many are likely to have substantial vulnerability to climate change. Additional research is needed to elucidate vulnerability within populations.","non-rct observational study","International journal of epidemiology","1","10.1093/ije/dyn086","https://consensus.app/papers/international-study-of-temperature-heat-and-urban-mcmichael-wilkinson/3759ca520d865ef983dc0a91264ae01a/"

"Heat and Cardiovascular Mortality: An Epidemiological Perspective","Extreme heat is linked to increased cardiovascular disease mortality, particularly in vulnerable subgroups like older people, those with preexisting conditions, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.","Nidhi Singh, A. T. Areal, S. Breitner, Siqi Zhang, S. Agewall, T. Schikowski, Alexandra Schneider",2024,28,"As global temperatures rise, extreme heat events are projected to become more frequent and intense. Extreme heat causes a wide range of health effects, including an overall increase in morbidity and mortality. It is important to note that while there is sufficient epidemiological evidence for heat-related increases in all-cause mortality, evidence on the association between heat and cause-specific deaths such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (and its more specific causes) is limited, with inconsistent findings. Existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies on heat and CVD mortality have summarized the available evidence. However, the target audience of such reviews is mainly limited to the specific field of environmental epidemiology. This overarching perspective aims to provide health professionals with a comprehensive overview of recent epidemiological evidence of how extreme heat is associated with CVD mortality. The rationale behind this broad perspective is that a better understanding of the effect of extreme heat on CVD mortality will help CVD health professionals optimize their plans to adapt to the changes brought about by climate change and heat events. To policymakers, this perspective would help formulate targeted mitigation, strengthen early warning systems, and develop better adaptation strategies. Despite the heterogeneity in evidence worldwide, due in part to different climatic conditions and population dynamics, there is a clear link between heat and CVD mortality. The risk has often been found to be higher in vulnerable subgroups, including older people, people with preexisting conditions, and the socioeconomically deprived. This perspective also highlights the lack of evidence from low- and middle-income countries and focuses on cause-specific CVD deaths. In addition, the perspective highlights the temporal changes in heat-related CVD deaths as well as the interactive effect of heat with other environmental factors and the potential biological pathways. Importantly, these various aspects of epidemiological studies have never been fully investigated and, therefore, the true extent of the impact of heat on CVD deaths remains largely unknown. Furthermore, this perspective also highlights the research gaps in epidemiological studies and the potential solutions to generate more robust evidence on the future consequences of heat on CVD deaths.","systematic review","Circulation Research","1","10.1161/circresaha.123.323615","https://consensus.app/papers/heat-and-cardiovascular-mortality-an-epidemiological-singh-areal/f16da8a7540e5a1c946f2aff84a92833/"

However, less evidence is available on the variation in the associations between temperature and mortality in multiple countries, analyzed simultaneously. Methods: We obtained daily data on temperature and mortality in 306 communities from 12 countries/regions (Australia, Brazil, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada). Two-stage analyses were used to assess the nonlinear and delayed relation between temperature and mortality. In the first stage, a Poisson regression allowing overdispersion with distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the community-specific temperature-mortality relation. In the second stage, a multivariate meta-analysis was used to pool the nonlinear and delayed effects of ambient temperature at the national level, in each country. Results: The temperatures associated with the lowest mortality were around the 75th percentile of temperature in all the countries/regions, ranging from 66th (Taiwan) to 80th (UK) percentiles. The estimated effects of cold and hot temperatures on mortality varied by community and country. Meta-analysis results show that both cold and hot temperatures increased the risk of mortality in all the countries/regions. Cold effects were delayed and lasted for many days, whereas heat effects appeared quickly and did not last long. Conclusions: People have some ability to adapt to their local climate type, but both cold and hot temperatures are still associated with increased risk of mortality.

The health burden associated with temperature is expected to increase due to a warming climate. Populations living in cities are likely to be particularly at risk, but the role of urban characteristics in modifying the direct effects of temperature on health is still unclear. In this contribution, we used a multi-country dataset to study effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships by a range of city-specific indicators.


METHODS
We collected ambient temperature and mortality daily time-series data for 340 cities in 22 countries, in periods between 1985 and 2014. Standardized measures of demographic, socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental indicators were derived from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Regional and Metropolitan Database. We used distributed lag non-linear and multivariate meta-regression models to estimate fractions of mortality attributable to heat and cold (AF%) in each city, and to evaluate the effect modification of each indicator across cities.


RESULTS
Heat- and cold-related deaths amounted to 0.54% (95% confidence interval: 0.49 to 0.58%) and 6.05% (5.59 to 6.36%) of total deaths, respectively. Several city indicators modify the effect of heat, with a higher mortality impact associated with increases in population density, fine particles (PM2.5), gross domestic product (GDP) and Gini index (a measure of income inequality), whereas higher levels of green spaces were linked with a decreased effect of heat.


CONCLUSIONS
This represents the largest study to date assessing the effect modification of temperature-mortality relationships. Evidence from this study can inform public-health interventions and urban planning under various climate-change and urban-development scenarios.","","International journal of epidemiology","1","10.1093/ije/dyz008","https://consensus.app/papers/how-urban-characteristics-affect-vulnerability-to-heat-sera-armstrong/c7a15e9b01ed5d5cb4e752bd07791c39/"

In Brazil, an example of that is the impact of cold and heat waves on public health. In order to analyse the temporal and spatial variability of such events, this study applied a single criterion to identify cold and heat waves. The study collected data on the events from daily temperature records from 264 weather stations over 56 years (1961–2016). The following parameters were used to describe each event: frequency, duration, severity, and intensity. The results showed that in all the Brazilian regions the frequency of heat waves increased and that of cold waves decreased between the years 1961 and 2016. The number of heat waves per year, notably, was greater than that of cold waves, and the mean duration of heat waves was about 1 day longer than that of cold waves. Additionally, it was found that cold waves were more severe and intense in areas often reached by cold air masses with temperatures below zero in most of Southern Brazil. In terms of severity and intensity of heat waves, two different configurations were observed: They were more severe in the Southern region and more intense in the Midwestern region of the country, and not so expressive in the Northern and Northeastern regions. Those findings justify the need for continuous updating of public policies focused on sectors often affected by cold and heat.","","International Journal of Climatology","2","10.1002/joc.6345","https://consensus.app/papers/the-climatology-of-cold-and-heat-waves-in-brazil-from-1961-to-bitencourt-fuentes/d52ab02f35e65f79a9f0ee6fbdbe3e0f/"
